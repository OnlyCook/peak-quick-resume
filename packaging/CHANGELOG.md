# Changelog

## 0.3.0
- **Miscellaneous QoL: pause menu buttons.** Three extra buttons are injected into the vanilla pause menu:
  - **Restart** (mid-run, host-only): returns everyone to the Airport and immediately starts a fresh run of the same difficulty, no checkpoint is loaded.
  - **Return to Airport** (mid-run, host-only): sends everyone back to the Airport without starting a new run.
  - **Board Flight** (at the Airport, any player): opens the gate-kiosk UI directly, skipping the walk over to it.
  - Each is independently toggleable in config (`PauseMenu` section) and confirms before acting on Restart/Return to Airport.
- **Localized** into every language the game ships (French, Italian, German, Spanish Spain/Latam, Portuguese Brazil, Russian, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Turkish), both the button labels and their confirm dialogs. Translations were done with AI, if one reads wrong in your language, please open a GitHub issue.
- Appended `_DEPRECATED` to `requireDoublePress` / `doublePressWindow` config keys in settings. 

## 0.2.0
- **In-game save picker (F7):** browse all your checkpoints (newest first) and load any of them from anywhere. Arrow keys to select, F7/Enter to load, Del to delete (twice to confirm), Esc to close.
- **Multiple saves per difficulty:** checkpoints are now archived instead of overwritten, so older campfires are kept and can be revisited (even mid-run, without losing the run's later saves). PEAK Checkpoint Save's own files are untouched.
- **Custom-run support:** custom difficulty runs can now be resumed, not just the standard difficulties.
- Pressing **F7 twice still loads your latest checkpoint**, exactly as before.
- `requireDoublePress` / `doublePressWindow` config are deprecated (superseded by the picker's confirm step).

## 0.1.1
- Description and README updated.

## 0.1.0
Initial release.

- Press **F7** (twice to confirm) to start a fresh run of your saved difficulty and automatically load your **PEAK Checkpoint Save** checkpoint.
- Works after death, from the Airport, and mid-run.
- Full co-op support (host-driven): all players are returned to the Airport, brought into the fresh run, and restored together.
- On-screen prompts, configurable resume key, double-press confirmation, and advanced timing options.
